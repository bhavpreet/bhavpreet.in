		    "description":"After moving to Delhi, where my parents chose to settle, I began exploring the city with new eyes. I was not quiet sure what I was looking for. Maybe, a sense of belonging? Which was always lacking but never missed. I found myself walking through the crowded by-lanes and underpasses canopied by wires of all sorts. Pigeons are everywhere, witness to the consistent decay the city presents. Here, new and old collide into a constant rush. The city reflects back on to me, my own confusions, which has formed a basis of my relation with it.",
